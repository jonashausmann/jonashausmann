## Hello!

I'm Jonas!  

My interest is in biophysics and computational biology especially pertaining to autophagy and associated proteins such as mTORC1, AMPK, and $\alpha$-klotho.

I am a current senior Physics student at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania who is looking to go to graduate school
